Here is the plan for the LTI forum 

Have a few options for types of forums:

Simple: Topic with non threaded response. 
    a) anon aliases
    b) real ids (with warning that instructor knows who you are)

Threaded: Topic with threaded responses 

{ NOTE : I am really going to have to work on the db schema so 
    things do not get too big. Some things to think about:

    1) Per class - Course ID from Sakai
    2) Per topic - Topics created by the professor
    3) Per type of forum - Simple vs. Threaded 

????? How big of a table can we have?
????? Should there be multiple tables?




}

Authentication:

LTI

INSTRUCTOR
1) Instructor control panel
    a) choose type of forum
    b) command topics
    c) comment
    d) view
    e) view anon with alias alias
    f) view real students

STUDENT
    a) comment
    b) view anon (students can only see anon ids) 


// Notes on attendance tool

Need to know: 

    date when class starts
    date when class ends
    this is the span of the class

    how the class repeats each week (these are events)
    
    are there any holidays that can be zapped (by consumer admin)

    there are things that need to be kept track of per student
        did they: show / no show / late
        the above needs to tally    

    keep track of the students


// Elements

tables:

event 
    id
    name (course)
    start_date
    end_date
    interval    [ human readable th,th ] 
    meet_time 
    


meta_event
    id          (id)
    event_id    (tied to event id)
    meta_key    : repeat_start / repeat_interval1 / repeat_interval2 
    meta_value  : seconds values (whatever day repeat) 1 gives us single time




course = Bio 101
course meet times = M,W 10:00am-12:00pm

event = each time the class meets

student = lms id from lti 
grade =
